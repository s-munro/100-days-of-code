**Today's Progress**: Began Angela Yu's Complete Web Dev 2020 Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Looking to get back into programming and hone in on some of my skills.  I would like to complete this course, as well as Angela Yu's course, to become more advanced, and eventually begin working in tech.  Follow along, here we go!

### Day 1: July 26, 2020. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Day 1 of Angela's course.  Today I put 3 hours into it, so I could complete the intermediate HTML section.  I'm trying to fly through the HTML and CSS sections, so that I can pick up where I once left off, touching up on JavaScript and learning the other relevant languages for Full-Stack dev.

**Thoughts** Feeling good.  I realized that the course is around 54 hours long of direct videos, and then some extra time with assignments, note-taking, et cetera.  It's a lot, but I'd like to have it under my belt.  The goal is to fork a couple of hours into it per day, so I can complete it within the next 2 months.  We'll see what happens though, since I'm not sure what to expect as the course moves on.  Today's progress can be viewed below!

### Day 2: July 27, 2020. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 (three (woop!)) of Angela's course.  Today I put a couple more hours into it, and got a little past halfway through the CSS and intermediate CSS portions.  I meant to get all the way through, but that may have been a little ambitious.  A lot of this was still review, but I nevertheless encountered some obstacles and stumbled for a moment.  I've now scrapped that initial website and began working on a semi-official CV website.  I'm going to be introducing myself as a developer, and showing some of my design (and minor developmental) skills.  I'm sure I'll keep working on it until its looking nice and neat.  For the time being, I don't have any links to prove it.  I'll take a screenshot and upload the photo tomorrow though.  Today, I don't have much to show.  See you again tomorrow morning!

**Thoughts** This course is very interesting, Angela gives a lot of freedom with the learning, which is a sort of double-edged sword, since it leads to a lot of open-ended googling and challenge.  I'm going to complete the final two hours of CSS tomorrow and begin on Bootstrap.  Things are going to get interesting tomorrow.

### Day 3: July 28, 2020. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Still going!  Today I didn't get quite as far as I wanted, since I'd like to go to sleep early, but I still made quite a bit of progress.  More than an hour, easily.  Today we dug further into CSS, and began styling some parts of our own personal website.  It took me much longer to get through the lesson than I anticipated, but that's really no problem.  A lot of my time was put into learning stylistic elements like position (absolute, relative, fixed), and display (inline, inline-block, etc.).  I still need to look into display, since it's seeming to slip my mind a little.  We'll get back to that before I go to sleep though.  In the meanwhile, see below to view some of today's work.

**Thoughts** Not many thoughts today.  Other than that it's going to take a long time to finish this course.  I'd like to start putting my phone away when I work, so I make sure im distraction-free.  I also want to put quite a few hours in this weekend, so I can hurry up and finish the course.  I'm already looking into what's next.  Im thinking "Advanced CSS and SASS" and "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020" by Jonas Schmedtmann, then "JavaScript: Understanding the weird parts" By Anthony Alicea.  PHEW, what a thing.  Those ones are significantly shorter though (god bless).
