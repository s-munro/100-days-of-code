**Today's Progress**: Began Angela Yu's Complete Web Dev 2020 Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Looking to get back into programming and hone in on some of my skills.  I would like to complete this course, as well as Angela Yu's course, to become more advanced, and eventually begin working in tech.  Follow along, here we go!

### Day 1: July 26, 2020. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of Angela's course.  Today I put 3 hours into it, so I could complete the intermediate HTML section.  I'm trying to fly through the HTML and CSS sections, so that I can pick up where I once left off, touching up on JavaScript and learning the other relevant languages for Full-Stack dev.

**Thoughts** Feeling good.  I realized that the course is around 54 hours long of direct videos, and then some extra time with assignments, note-taking, et cetera.  It's a lot, but I'd like to have it under my belt.  The goal is to fork a couple of hours into it per day, so I can complete it within the next 2 months.  We'll see what happens though, since I'm not sure what to expect as the course moves on.  Today's progress can be viewed below!

### Day 2: July 27, 2020. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 (three (woop!)) of Angela's course.  Today I put a couple more hours into it, and got a little past halfway through the CSS and intermediate CSS portions.  I meant to get all the way through, but that may have been a little ambitious.  A lot of this was still review, but I nevertheless encountered some obstacles and stumbled for a moment.  I've now scrapped that initial website and began working on a semi-official CV website.  I'm going to be introducing myself as a developer, and showing some of my design (and minor developmental) skills.  I'm sure I'll keep working on it until its looking nice and neat.  For the time being, I don't have any links to prove it.  I'll take a screenshot and upload the photo tomorrow though.  Today, I don't have much to show.  See you again tomorrow morning!

**Thoughts** This course is very interesting, Angela gives a lot of freedom with the learning, which is a sort of double-edged sword, since it leads to a lot of open-ended googling and challenge.  I'm going to complete the final two hours of CSS tomorrow and begin on Bootstrap.  Things are going to get interesting tomorrow.
